- 👋 Hi, I’m Regan Moyes.
- 👀 I’m interested in Client-Side development. I'm a sucker for all the pretty things so CSS is right up my alley. But I'm also a Creative Writer so I have a soft spot for HTML and copywriting too.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Agile and DevOps as part of my Diploma in Web Development and Design with Developers Institute.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web design projects. 
- 📫 My inbox is open 24/7 so feel free to send me an email at regardingregan@gmail.com.
